I've been working on my vim configuration from time to time now for about 4 years. With this post I would like to go through it and show you what am I using for web development. Also in the near future I would like to start updating my configuration and move it eventually to `lua` as it's fully supported in neovim but first I need to refresh my memory about current configuration and I think writing about it is the best way to achieve it. I want to create few posts about this process so you can treat this post as the first part.

You can see each file in my [yadf](https://github.com/Krol22/yadf/tree/master/nvim) (yet-another-dot-files) repository.

My neovim setup is splitted into several files:

- `init.vim` - initial nvim file. Contains all plugins and loads other .vim files
- `config.vim` - main configuration file, contains all commands,
- `day.vim` - small plugin for toggling light/dark theme,
- `coc-settings.json` - settings for coc plugin,
- `eslint-local.vim` - small plugin for launching local eslint instead of global,
- `coc.vim` - basic configuration for coc plugin,

We will go through each of them.

### init.vim

Loads all of the plugins that I'm currently using in my standard workflow. Also it's loading rest of my `.vim` files. For plugin loading I'm using Vundle as I never had any problem with it and didn't need to move to different plugins manager.

This is my current (2021-04-09) list of plugins:

- [VundleVim/Vundle.vim](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) - vim plugin manager,
- [neoclide/coc.nvim](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim) - VSCode autocompletion
- [neomake/neomake](https://github.com/neomake/neomake) - asynchronous code linting,
- [scrooloose/nerdcommenter](https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdcommenter) - comment functions so powerful--no comment necessary,
- [jiangmiao/auto-pairs](https://github.com/jiangmiao/auto-pairs) - insert/delete brackets, parens, quotes in pair,
- [mg979/vim-visual-multi](https://github.com/mg979/vim-visual-multi) - multiple cursors support,
- [alvan/vim-closetag](https://github.com/alvan/vim-closetag) - autoclose HTML tags,
- [elzr/vim-json](https://github.com/elzr/vim-json) - highlighting JSON for vim,
- [Yggdroot/indentLine](https://github.com/Yggdroot/indentLine) - show vertical lines at each indentation level of code,
- [romainl/vim-qf](https://github.com/romainl/vim-qf) - vim quickfix window,
- [othree/yajs.vim](https://github.com/othree/yajs.vim) - JS syntax highlighting for vim,
- [tpope/vim-surround](https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround) - remove and add parentheses, brackets, quotes, XML tags, and more with ease,
- [tpope/vim-vinegar](https://github.com/tpope/vim-vinegar)- netrw (built in directory browser) but better,
- [tpope/vim-sleuth](https://github.com/tpope/vim-sleuth) - automatically adjusts 'shiftwidth' and 'expandtab' based on current file,
- [benjie/local-npm-bin.vim](https://github.com/benjie/local-npm-bin.vim) -
- [luochen1990/rainbow](https://github.com/luochen1990/rainbow) - rainbow parentheses,
- [leafgarland/typescript-vim](https://github.com/leafgarland/typescript-vim),
- [peitalin/vim-jsx-typescript](https://github.com/peitalin/vim-jsx-typescript) - syntax for TypeScript,
- [junegunn/fzf.vim](https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim) - fzf for vim,
- [MaxMEllon/vim-jsx-pretty](https://github.com/MaxMEllon/vim-jsx-pretty) - React syntax highlighting and indenting plugin,
- [vim-airline/vim-airline](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline) - better status bar for vim,
- [vim-airline/vim-airline-themes](https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline-themes) - themes for status bar,

And for colors I'm currently using these two:
- [sainnhe/vim-color-vanilla-cake](https://github.com/sainnhe/vim-color-vanilla-cake) - light theme,
- [ntk148v/vim-horizon](https://github.com/ntk148v/vim-horizon) - dark theme,

Most of them I use without any additional configuration. For rest of them I have a simple configurations in `config.vim` file.

### config.vim

Contains all of the configuration for neovim and plugins. In the history it was pretty long file but now (146 lines) I'm happy with this "shorter" result. TBH I would like to shrink it even more.

I've splitted my configuration for few parts:

1. Mappings - contains basic shortcuts for nativation:

```vim
  nmap <silent> <C-h> :winc h<CR> "Ctrl + h -> move to pane on left,
  nmap <silent> <C-j> :winc j<CR> "Ctrl + j -> move to pane below,
  nmap <silent> <C-k> :winc k<CR> "Ctrl + k -> move to pane above,
  nmap <silent> <C-l> :winc l<CR> "Ctrl + l -> move to pane on right,

  nmap <silent> <C-q> :q <CR> " Ctrl + q -> quit file,
  nmap <silent> <C-s> :w <CR> " Ctrl + s -> save file,

  tnoremap <C-R> <C-\><C-n> " Ctrl + r -> exit from Terminal mode,

  nmap <silent> <C-P> :Files<CR> " Ctrl + p -> open fzf

  nmap <C-_> <leader>c<space> "Ctrl + / -> comment line under cursor
  vmap <C-_> <leader>c<space> "Ctrl + / -> comment selected lines
```

Beside from default vim stuff these are the most used by me shortcuts. For rest I usually use Tab (for omni menu movement) and Ctrl + Space (triggers auto completion menu)

2. Configs - contains configuration for vim. In this part I have my basic configuration for vim -> line numbers, indent, swap files etc. Each file contains comment with description so it should be easy for you to understand what each line/lines does.

3. Neomake - configuration for async linters. Currently enabled makers

- javascript - eslint,
- html - htmlhint,
- cpp - clang,
- typescript - tslint,

For eslint you can see that there is an extra option set `let b:neomake_javascript_eslint_exe = GetNpmBin('eslint')`. GetNpmBin is a custom function that I use for neomake to use local project eslint instead of global one installed in system if there is one available. It's defined in `eslint-local.vim`. Rest of this configuration is pretty standard.

4. Comments - comments section contains some basic configuration for nerdcommenter plugin.
5. fzf - configuration for showing fzf on this fancy window. You can see how it should look on the gif below.

TODO -> gif here,

### day.vim  
- It's my small script for toggling between light and dark theme. Very simple to use, just press Ctrl-g in normal or visual mode to toggle themes between `horizon` and `vanilla-cake`. You can easily change these themes in line 4 and 5 or by setting `g:dark_colorscheme` and `g:light_colorscheme` variables to correct values.

### coc.vim
- It's a copied version of example configuration for coc extension. TBH I was so pleased to use it and I didn't change it at all. You can see it [here](https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim#example-vim-configuration).

!Note - if you plan to use this configuration. After installing all plugins with `:PlugInstall` you need to install coc-tsserver extension for coc. You can do it with `:CocInstall` command:

```
  :CocInstall coc-tsserver
```

I user 3 more extensions [coc-emmet](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-emmet), [coc-markdownlint](https://github.com/fannheyward/coc-markdownlint) and [coc-tabnine](https://github.com/neoclide/coc-tabnine)

Workflow or maybe what I like the most from my configuration. 

- short and very easy to understand and use,
- full autocompletion tslint engine easily available with just one key `TAB`


- auto code linting on save,

- easy pane movement,

- quick movement between files with fzf window,

TODO -> gif here

- multiple coursors,

- changing surroundings,
